# Open Source Behavior Tree Framework

## Overview

### Real Robot Trajectories
Real robots execute planned trajectories. While the robot itself doesnâ€™t differentiate between types of motion, humans identify patterns in these trajectories, such as "approaching an object" or "rotating an object." These reusable motion patterns are defined in our framework as **Primitives**.

- **Primitive Example**: `MoveToPose`, `Rotate`
- **Functionality**: Each primitive generates a trajectory that the robot can directly execute. This is implemented using MoveIt.

### Task Decomposition
Any task can be broken down into primitives connected in a sequence. 

For example:

**Task**: Fill a beaker with liquid from a test tube  
**Primitives**: `MoveTo(TestTube) -> Grasp() -> MoveTo(Beaker) -> Rotate(TestTube)`

This chain of primitives is called **ModuleCollections** in our framework. Behavior Trees (BT) handle the chaining of these primitives.

### Developer Contributions
Developers can contribute by adding new primitives and modules through a defined process. Once primitives and modules are available, a Behavior Tree is generated using our utility program.


1. **Include Directory**:
   - **Primitives**: Defines primitives as Behavior Tree nodes.

2. **RAS_BT_Framework**: Core of the Behavior Tree generation utility.
   - **Behavior**: Contributors add modules and primitives here.
   - **Managers**: Handles the generation of the final XML file for the Behavior Tree.

3. **Scripts**:
   - `batman.py`: Coordinates with `BTExecutor.cpp` to run behaviors built using `BehaviorTreeGenerator`.
   - `TrajectoryRecordsService.py`: Records trajectories generated by primitives for use on real robots.

4. **Src**:
   - `BTExecutor.cpp`: Manages and executes Behavior Trees in a ROS 2 environment using the `BehaviorTree.CPP` library.

5. **XML Directory**:
   - Stores generated Behavior Trees for simulation and real-world execution.
